# Civix

## Introduction

The [`civix`](https://github.com/totten/civix/) command-line tool is the
community-endorsed method for building your CiviCRM extensions.

Follow the installation instructions in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/totten/civix/).

After fulfilling the [Pre-Requisites](/extensions/basics/#pre-requisites), you can verify that all your configuration is correct by running the following command from
within your extensions directory with:

```bash
civix civicrm:ping
```

This command should reply with "Ping successful".
If the ping is unsuccessful, re-read the civix README.md and do the
post-installation configuration.

It is also useful to examine the output of the `civix help` command to read
about what `civix` can do for you.

Help is available on individual commands, e.g.:

```bash
civix help civicrm:ping
```

## Generating a skeletal extension {:#generate-module}

To generate a skeletal extension module, we will use `civix generate:module`
and pass in the name for our extension. See [here](/extensions/basics/#extension-names)
for details of naming conventions.

Start with:

```bash
cd $YOUR_EXTENSIONS_DIR
civix generate:module --help
```

Then use a command like this:

```bash
civix generate:module com.example.myextension --license=AGPL-3.0
```

This command will report that it has created three files, following the
[standard extension structure](/extensions/files).

The command attempts to auto-detect authorship information (your name and
email address) by reading your
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
configuration. If this fails or is
otherwise incorrect, then you may pass explicit values with `--author`
and `--email`.

You can now update your `info.xml`. This file initially contains some
examples and placeholders which you need to fix. You can edit most of these
fields intuitively.  If you need detailed specifications, see [Extension
Reference](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extension+Reference).

Now that you have created your extension, you need to activate it by navigating
to:

**Administer » System Settings » Manage Extensions**

or

**Administer » Customize Data and Screens » Manage Extensions.**

For more detailed instructions, see
[Extensions](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions).

## Add features

There are many different features that you can add to a module-extension
at your discretion. A few possibilities:

### Add a basic web page {:#generate-page}

CiviCRM uses a typical web-MVC architecture. To implement a basic web
page, you must create a PHP controller class, create a Smarty template
file, and create a routing rule. You can create the appropriate files by
calling `civix generate:page`

Once again you can review the output of this command to see the available options:

```bash
civix generate:page --help
```

Generally you will only need to supply the PHP class name and web-path,
for example:

```bash
civix generate:page MyPage civicrm/my-page
```

This creates three files:

-   `xml/Menu/myextension.xml` defines request-routing rules and
    associates the controller ("CRM_Myextension_Page_Greeter") with
    the web path `civicrm/my-page`.
-   `CRM/Myextension/Page/MyPage.php` is the controller which
    coordinates any parsing, validation, business-logic, or database
    operations.
-   `templates/CRM/Myextension/Page/MyPage.tpl` is loaded
    automatically after the controller executes. It defines the markup
    that is eventually displayed. For more information on the syntax of
    this file, see
    [the smarty guide](http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/).

The auto-generated code for the controller and view demonstrate a few
basic operations, such as passing data from the controller to the view.

!!! note
    After adding or modifying a route in the XML file, you must reset
    CiviCRMs "menu cache". Do this in a web browser by visiting
    `/civicrm/menu/rebuild?reset=1` or by running
    `drush cc civicrm` if using Drupal & Drush.

**Edit In Place**

If the data on the page is read and updated through the API, then you
may want to consider using the
[in-place editing](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/In-Place+Field+Editing) API.

### Add a basic web form {:#generate-form}

!!! caution
    The form system is not well documented and may undergo significant
    revision after the CiviCRM 4.x series. In general, migrating basic pages
    will be easier than migrating basic forms, so you may want
    to consider building your data-input interface  using basic pages, the AJAX
    API, and the
    [in-place editing](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/In-Place+Field+Editing) API.

CiviCRM uses a typical web-MVC architecture. To implement a basic web
form, you must create a PHP controller class, create a Smarty template
file, and create a routing rule. You can create the appropriate files by
calling `civix generate:form`.

The form generation command has similar arguments to `civix generate:page`,
requiring a class name and a web route:

```bash
civix generate:form FavoriteColor civicrm/favcolor
```

This creates three files:

-   `xml/Menu/myextension.xml` defines request-routing rules and
    associates the controller `CRM_Myextension_Form_FavoriteColor`
    with the web path `civicrm/favcolor`.
-   `CRM/Myextension/Form/FavoriteColor.php` is the controller which
    coordinates any parsing, validation, business-logic, or database
    operations. For more details on how this class works, see [QuickForm
    Reference](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/QuickForm+Reference).
-   `templates/CRM/Myextension/Form/FavoriteColor.tpl` is loaded
    automatically after the controller executes. It defines the markup
    that is eventually displayed. For more information on the syntax of
    this file, see
    [the smarty guide](http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/).

The auto-generated code for the controller and view demonstrate a few
basic operations, such as adding a `<select>` element to the form.

!!! note
    After adding or modifying a route in the XML file, you must reset
    CiviCRMs "menu cache". This can be done in a web browser by visiting
    `/civicrm/menu/rebuild?reset=1`

### Add a new entity {:#generate-entity}

!!! caution
    This functionality is considered "experimental and incomplete".

If you want your extension to store data in the database, then you will need
to create a new entity. For this, you can use the command `civix generate:entity`

1. Pick a name for your entity.

    * In some places, CiviCRM expects a *CamelCaseName*, in others, an *snake_case_name*. Be absolutely consistent in your naming, because CiviCRM needs to translate between those two naming conventions.

    * Also consider that all entity names (including yours) should be unique across all core entities as well as all extension entities (for all installed extensions). Thus in many cases it's best to prefix your entity name with the short name of your extension.

    * For the remainder of this tutorial, we will use `MyEntity` as the name of the entity.

1. Run `civix generate:entity MyEntity` (use CamelCase here). This creates a skeletal file for your XML schema, your BAO, and your API. It does NOT create a skeletal SQL file to create your table or DAO files at this time.

1. Edit the [XML schema definitions](/framework/schema-definition) in the `xml` folder to define your desired fields.

1. Generate a [DAO file](/core/architecture/#dao) and SQL to create your table. *(For now, civix does not handle this part. Hopefully these steps will become easier at some point in the future.)*

    1. Begin with a development installation of CiviCRM core (e.g. as installed with buildkit) which has a clean git status. We will henceforth refer to the CiviCRM root directory within this installation as `<civiroot>`. This core installation can actually be any installation, not necessarily the one you're using to develop your extension. We're basically just temporarily hijacking its environment to generate DAO and SQL.

    1. Copy your custom XML schema file (e.g. `MyEntity.xml`) into `<civiroot>/xml/schema/`.

    1. Edit `<civiroot>/xml/schema/Schema.xml` and add the following lines *before* the final `</database>` line, making sure to replace `MyEntity` with the name of your entity.
        ```xml
        <tables xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
            <xi:include href="MyEntity.xml" parse="xml"/>
        </tables>
        ```

    1. Run `<civiroot>/bin/setup.sh -g` to re-generate DAO and SQL files. (Note that if you use git to see which files changed after this step you won't see the SQL since it's ignored by git.)

        * *Prior to CiviCRM 4.7.12, you would instead run `php ./GenCode.php` from the `xml` folder.*

    1. Copy the DAO file `<civiroot>/CRM/MyEntity/DAO/MyEntity.php` into your extension at `CRM/MyEntity/DAO/MyEntity.php`.

    1. Within your extension, create an `sql` directory and create two empty files within it: `auto_install.sql` and `auto_uninstall.sql`.

    1. Open `<civiroot>/sql/civicrm.mysql` and search for the name of your entity to the find relevant queries.

        1. Copy the `DROP TABLE` query into `auto_install.sql` and `auto_uninstall.sql`.

        1. Copy the `CREATE TABLE` query into `auto_install.sql`.

    1. Clean up the mess you created in the CiviCRM core installation.

        1. In `<civiroot>` run `git clean -df && git checkout -- .` to throw away all the changes there.

        1. Run `./bin/setup.sh -g` again to re-generate DAO and SQL (DAO should remain un-changed after this step but the SQL, which is ignored in git, will now go back to its state before you started).

1. Run `civix generate:upgrader` from within your extension. (Even though you're not yet creating any upgrades for your extension, you need to do this step now so that CiviCRM will pick up `auto_install.sql` and `auto_uninstall.sql`

1. Define your entity using [hook_civicrm_entityTypes](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/hook_civicrm_entityTypes).

### Add a database upgrader, installer and uninstaller {:#generate-upgrader}

If your module requires creating or maintaining SQL tables, then you
should create a class for managing database upgrades. The upgrader adds
a class for managing installs and upgrades but you then need to edit the file
comment out the various upgrade and uninstall functions
to make it work. Generally your install script belongs in an `sql/` folder
in the root of your extension with a name like 'install'

This `civix` command does not require arguments:

```bash
civix generate:upgrader
```

This creates two files and one directory:

-   `CRM/Myextension/Upgrader.php` stores a series of upgrade
    functions based on a function naming pattern similar to
    Drupal's
    [hook_update_N](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_update_N/7).
    After examining the file's comments for example upgrade functions
    you can then write your own.
-   `CRM/Myextension/Upgrader/Base.php` contains helper functions
    and adapters which make it easier to write the upgrader. This file
    may be overwritten from time-to-time to provide new helpers or
    adapters.
-   sql

After reviewing the examples and creating your own upgrade functions,
you can execute the upgrades through the web interface by visiting the
"Manage Extensions" screen. This screen will display an alert with an
action-link to perform the upgrades.

!!! note
    The "upgrader" class is a wrapper for
    [hook_civicrm_upgrade](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Hook+Reference)
    which aims to be easy-to-use for developers with Drupal experience. If
    you need to organize the upgrade logic differently, then consider
    providing your own implementation of hook_civicrm_upgrade.

!!! caution
    Only use the upgrade system to manage new SQL
    tables. Do not manipulate core schema.

If you need to create triggers on core SQL tables, use
[hook_civicrm_triggerInfo](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Hook+Reference).
This allows your triggers to coexist with triggers from other modules.

### Add a case type {:#generate-case-type}

*(from CiviCRM v4.4+)*

If you want to develop a custom case-type for CiviCase, then you can
generate a skeletal CiviCase XML file.

Once again `civix` will give the details of options and arguments with this
command:

```bash
civix help generate:case-type
```

This reports that civix expects a label argument and an optional name:

```bash
civix generate:case-type "Volunteer Training" Training
```

This creates two files:

-   `xml/case/Training.xml` defines the roles, activity types, and
    timelines associated with the new case type. For more in depth
    discussion of CiviCase XML, see
    [CiviCase Configuration](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/CiviCase+Configuration).
-   `alltypes.civix.php`(which may already exist) defines
    implementations of various hooks (notably hook_civicrm_caseTypes).

### Add custom fields

*(from CiviCRM v4.4+)*

Your extension can create one or more sets of custom
fields at installation. There are two
methods depending on whether the custom data set extends an entity
(e.g. "Individual" – without any specific subtype)
or extends a specific subtype of an entity.
(e.g. Activities of type 'Volunteer')

#### Extending a base entity

This is the simplest scenario.
Start by creating a custom fields using the web interface and then export
them for use with the extension:

!!! note
    Before you begin verify that civix is connected to your instance of
    CiviCRM by running `civix civicrm:ping`.

-   On your development instance of CiviCRM, create the new custom
    fields using the web interface. Note the unique ID of the custom data
    group (also known as the "Custom Fieldset", "CustomGroup" or
    "civicrm_custom_group")
-   Create an XML file with `civix generate:custom-xml`
    specifying the custom-data group ID.
-   Create an upgrader file with `civix generate:upgrader` to
    load the XML file during installation.

Check the full range of options with the `civix` help command:

```bash
civix help generate:custom-xml
```

So to created your XML for a custom data group ID of 7:

```bash
civix generate:custom-xml --data=7
```

Most of the [CiviHR](https://github.com/civicrm/civihr/tree/master) modules rely on the first approach (e.g.:
[Upgrader/Base.php](https://github.com/civicrm/civihr/blob/master/hrqual/CRM/HRQual/Upgrader/Base.php#L244) and
[auto_install.xml](https://github.com/civicrm/civihr/blob/master/hrqual/xml/auto_install.xml)).

#### Extending an subtype

<!-- This section still is not really clear to me. (Erich Schulz)
Is this really about sub-types in an OO sense?? or subtypes in as a base
entity of a particular type as defined by its properties?
-->

The automatic export does not work too well when the
custom-data group extends a specific subtype. The
"HR Emergency Contact" extension provides and example that creates
a custom-data group that describes
Relationships with type "Emergency Contact". Internally, Civi uses
"relationship type IDs", but those are not portable. As a quick
work-around, this extension uses Smarty:
([HREmerg/Upgrader.php](https://github.com/civicrm/civihr/blob/master/hremerg/CRM/HREmerg/Upgrader.php#L14)
and
[hremerg-customdata.xml.tpl](https://github.com/civicrm/civihr/blob/master/hremerg/templates/hremerg-customdata.xml.tpl#L11)).

To create this extension, the author used `civix generate:custom-data` and
then:

1. Renamed the `xml/auto_install.xml` to
 `templates/hremerg-customdata.xml.tpl`
2. Changed the value of `<extends_entity_column_value>` in the
  `.tpl file` using  a variable instead of a hard-coded type ID.
3. Added logic in the upgrader to create the relationship type
4. Added logic in the upgrader to evaluate the Smarty template

#### Accessing Custom Fields

For setting and getting custom field values in hooks, you need to know the field
ID of the custom field(s) you want to work with. You'll then access these 
fields as "custom_<ID>". So if you have a field holding a custom value whose 
ID in the civicrm_custom_field table is 34, you'll use "custom_34" to access it.

To get a custom field ID given the custom field name and custom group name, 
you can use the following code:

```php
require_once 'CRM/Core/BAO/CustomField.php';
$customFieldID = CRM_Core_BAO_CustomField::getCustomFieldID($field, $group);
```

Once you have the ID(s), you'll want to use the setValues and getValues 
functions in the CRM/Core/BAO/CustomValueTable.php file. Here are a couple 
of examples of their use:

Setting values:

```php
require_once 'CRM/Core/BAO/CustomValueTable.php';
$params = array('entityID' => $contribution_id, 'custom_34' => 'new val');
CRM_Core_BAO_CustomValueTable::setValues($params);
```

Getting values:

```php
$params = array( 'entityID' => 1327, 'custom_13' => 1, 'custom_43' => 1);
require_once 'CRM/Core/BAO/CustomValueTable.php';
$values = CRM_Core_BAO_CustomValueTable::getValues($params);
```

!!! caution
    Note that custom field values may not always be available when you 
    might expect.
    For instance, you can't retrieve custom field values in the 'create' 
    operation in the _pre and _post hooks, because the custom field values 
    haven't been stored yet. However, you can retrieve values in the 'edit' 
    operation.

### Add a hook function

CiviCRM
[hook functions](/hooks/)
allow extensions to run extra logic as
part of the normal CiviCRM processing. For example,
`hook_civicrm_buildForm()` allows a module to run logic whenever a
web-form is displayed, and `hook_civicrm_post()` allows a module to
run logic after any entity is saved.

Hook function names follow the Drupal convention of being
the module's short-name concatenated to the hook name. This strict but simple
naming convention is what allows the CiviCRM core to locate your hook
functions and call them at the appropriate times.
For example, if our module's main file is
`myextension.php` and we want to use `hook_civicrm_post()`
to write to a log file every time a contribution is saved, then our function must be called `myextension_civicrm_post()`:

To implement a hook, add a function to the module's main `.php`
file created earlier with `civix generate:module`:

```php
/**
 * Implementation of hook_civicrm_post
 */
function myextension_civicrm_post($op, $objectName, $objectId, &$objectRef) {
  switch ($objectName) {
    case 'Contribution':
      $file = '/tmp/contributions.log';
      $message = strtr("Performed \"@op\" at @time on contribution #@id\n", array(
        '@op' => $op,
        '@time' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
        '@id' => $objectId,
      ));
      file_put_contents($file, $message, FILE_APPEND);
      break;
    default:
      // nothing to do
  }
}
```

!!! note
    When you first created the skeletal project, several hook functions were
    auto-generated in `myextension.php`. These functions are usually about
    one line long – they simply delegate the work to another function. For
    example `myextension_civicrm_config()` delegates work to
    `_myextension_civix_civicrm_config()`. You should feel free to add
    more code to `myextension_civicrm_config()`, but you should preserve
    the call to `_myextension_civix_civicrm_config()`. <!-- fixme! why?? -->

### Add a resource file

To include static resources such as stylesheets, Javascript files, or
images place them in your extension directory. To load
the files at runtime, see the examples in the [Resource
Reference](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Resource+Reference).

### Add a report {:#generate-report}

CiviReport enables developers to define new business reports using
customizable SQL logic and form layouts.
If another existing report is close to your needs you may copy and modify it.

To to see the available report generation options activate the `civix` help:

```bash
civix generate:report --help
```

To create a new report specify the report PHP class name and the CiviCRM component, for example:

```bash
civix generate:report MyReport CiviContribute
```

This creates three files:

-   `CRM/Myextension/Form/Report/MyReport.mgd.php` stores metadata
    about the report in a format based on
    [hook_civicrm_managed](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Hook+Reference)
    and the
    [API](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/API+Reference).
-   `CRM/Myextension/Form/Report/MyReport.php` contains the
    form-builder and query-builder for the report. For details about its
    structure, see the [CiviReport
    Reference](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/CiviReport+Reference).
-   `templates/CRM/Myextension/Form/Report/MyReport.tpl` contains
    the report's HTML template. This template usually delegates
    responsibility to a core template and does not need to be edited.

If one of the existing reports is close to meeting
your needs, but requires further PHP or SQL customization, you may
simply make a new report based on that report.
To copy a report, find the class-name of the original report within the
`civicrm/CRM/Report/Form/` directory in the CiviCRM repository.
Then run the `civix generate:report` command using the copy option
from with your extension directory.

For example, this command will copy the activity report in the class
`CRM_Report_Form_Activity` to a new report within your extension:

```bash
civix generate:report --copy CRM_Report_Form_Activity MyActivity Contact
```

### Add a custom search {:#generate-search}

CiviCRM enables developers to define new search forms using customizable
SQL logic and form layouts. Use this command to get started:

```bash
civix help generate:search
```

Then you could generate your basic search code for a `MySearch` class with:

```bash
civix generate:search MySearch
```

This command will create two files:

-   `CRM/Myextension/Form/Search/MySearch.mgd.php` stores metadata
    about the custom search. The format of the file is based on
    [hook_civicrm_managed](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Hook+Reference)
    and the
    [API](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/API+Reference).
-   `CRM/Myextension/Form/Search/MySearch.php` contains the
    form-builder and query-builder for the custom search.

#### Copying an existing search

If one of the existing searches is close to
meeting your needs you may copy it instead and then customise the
PHP, SQL and templates.

To make a new search based on an existing search first determine the name of
the original search class within the `civicrm/CRM/Contact/Form/Search/Custom`
directory of CiviCRM source tree. Then run the `generate:search` command from
within your module directory.

For example, the zipcode search is in the class
`CRM_Contact_Form_Search_Custom_ZipCodeRange`, so you can copy it with:

```bash
civix generate:search --copy CRM_Contact_Form_Search_Custom_ZipCodeRange MySearch
```

The "copy" option will create either two or three files depending
on whether the original search screen defines its own Smarty template.

#### Using your search

1. Disable and re-enable your extension.

1. Go to **Search > Custom Searches...** and find your new custom search listed at the bottom.

#### Building your custom search

Now you have a working custom search, but how do you make it *do* something *custom*?

See this (somewhat outdated) [wiki page](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC46/Create+a+Custom-Search+Extension) for more information.


### Add an API function {:#generate-api}

The [CiviCRM API](/api/general)
provides a way to expose functions for use by other developers. API
functions allow implementing AJAX interfaces (using the
cj().crmAPI() helper), and they can also be called via REST, PHP,
Smarty, Drush CLI, and more. Each API requires a two-part name: an
entity name (such as "Contact", "Event", or "MyEntity") and an action
name (such as "Create" or "MyAction").

Get started by accessing the `civix` help:

```bash
civix help generate:api
```

!!! note
    Action names must be lowercase. The javascript helpers `CRM.api()` and
    `CRM.api3()` force actions to be lowercase. This issues does not present
    itself in the API Explorer or when the api action is called via PHP,
    REST, or SMARTY.

You can make your API code with a command in this pattern:

```bash
civix generate:api NewEntity NewAction
```

This creates one file:

-   `api/v3/NewEntity/NewAction.php` provides the API function.
    that the parameters and return values must be processed in a
    particular way (as demonstrated by the auto-generated file).

For use with CiviCRM 4.3 and later, you can also add the `–schedule` option (e.g.
`–schedule Hourly`). This will create another file:

-   `api/v3/NewEntity/NewAction.mgd.php` provides the scheduling
    record that will appear in the CiviCRM's job-manager.

### Add a unit-test class {:#generate-test}

Unit-testing is essential to maintain quality-control over
your extension. When developing a test case for a CiviCRM extension, it
is useful to run the test case within an active, clean CiviCRM
environment. The combined CiviCRM `civix` testing tools will automate this as
long as you follow a few basic conventions.

The following steps will create and run a test in your extension.

!!! note
    Before preparing unit-tests with extensions, you must first
    [configure you personal testing sandbox](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Setting+up+your+personal+testing+sandbox+HOWTO) and enable your extension on the sandbox.

Explore the full options with:

```bash
civix help generate:test
```

To create a skeletal test-class choose a class name in
your extension's namespace (*CRM_Myextension*) that ends with the
word *Test*:

```bash
civix generate:test CRM_Myextension_MyTest
```

This creates a new directory and a new PHP file:

-   `tests/phpunit` is the base directory for all test classes.
-   `tests/phpunit/CRM/Myextension/MyTest.php` is the actual test
    class. It should be written according to the conventions of
    [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html).

To make sure you can run the test civix needs to know where the CiviCRM
base install is:

The skeletal test class does not do anything useful. For more details on
how to write a test class:

-   Read [PHP Unit Manual: Writing Tests for
    PHPUnit.](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html)
-   Review the example code in
    [org.civicrm.exampletests](https://github.com/totten/org.civicrm.exampletests)

!!! caution
    The following instructions are deprecated. Updated instructions coming soon.

```bash
# Check if civix can connect to the civi api
civix civicrm:ping
# Look at your current config
civix config:get
# Tell civix where to read the civicrm.settings.php
# EG. For Drupal
civix config:set civicrm_api3_conf_path /your/path/to/sites/default
```

To run this test-class, change to your extension folder and run the following:

```bash
civix test CRM_Myextension_MyTest
```
